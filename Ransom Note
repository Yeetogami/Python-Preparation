Harold is a kidnapper who wrote a ransom note, but now he is worried it will
be traced back to him through his handwriting. He found a magazine and
wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create an untraceable replica of his ransom note. The words in his note are casesensitive and he must use only whole words available in the magazine. He cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words fp needs.
Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print Yes
if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the
magazine; otherwise, print No.
Example
magazine ="attack at dawn" note ="Attack at dawn"
The magazine has all the right words, but there is a case mismatch. The
answer is No.
